## Overview

This project is a Dynamic Quote Generator built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to view, add, filter, import, export, and sync quotes dynamically. The app demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation, data persistence, and client-server interaction concepts.

## Features

Display a random quote from a collection of quotes.

Add new quotes dynamically through a user interface.

Filter quotes by category using a dropdown menu.

Export quotes as a JSON file.

Import quotes from a JSON file and merge them into local storage.

Sync quotes with a mock server (simulating GET and POST requests) and handle conflicts where server data takes precedence.

## Concepts Learned

Advanced DOM Manipulation: Creating, updating, and removing elements dynamically based on user interactions.

Event Handling: Handling clicks, input events, and dropdown changes to drive interactivity.

Local Storage: Saving and loading data to persist quotes across sessions.

JSON Handling: Converting quotes to/from JSON for import/export.

Data Syncing & Conflict Resolution: Simulating server synchronization, detecting conflicts, and resolving them with server-first rules.

Error Handling: Using try/catch to manage network errors, invalid data, and local storage issues.

Frontend Engineering Practices: Structuring functions for modularity, clarity, and maintainability.

## Conclusion

By completing this exercise, I learned how to build a fully dynamic, interactive web application with JavaScript, handle persistent data, work with JSON import/export, implement mock server communication, and manage conflicts and synchronization, all without using frameworks. This exercise strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation, data flow, and real-world web app patterns.
